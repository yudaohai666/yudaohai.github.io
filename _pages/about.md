Iâ€™m a first-year graduate student from the School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University. My research interests include large language models for long-text processing and multimodal large models.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Rongrong Ji at the MAC Lab from the School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University. I am also co-advised by Asst. Prof. Zhanpeng Zeng.
